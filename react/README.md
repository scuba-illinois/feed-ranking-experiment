# Frontend

## Deployment

Some directions on how to deploy this React application.

### Install `node`/`npm`

The directions to install `node` and `npm` are located here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

If installed correctly, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm -v
node -v
```

These just get the version numbers for each.

### Installing Dependencies

Go to the `./react/` directory and run `npm run install`. Running this command should react a `./react/node_modules/` directory that has all the dependencies required to run this project locally.

### Deploy Locally

To deploy locally, run `npm run dev` in the `./react/` directory. That should start a local instance of the frontend. In the terminal, it should tell you which port the application is listening to on `localhost`. Type the URL into your web browser and you should be able to see the interface.
