// 		body: `I (18F) live with my dad and my stepmom (43F). My mom passed away when I was 10, and it's still a sensitive subject for me. My stepmom came into the picture a couple of years later, and while we're civil, we're definitely not close.

// She's always had this weird vibe ‚Äî like she's trying to compete with my mom even though my mom isn't here. She gets snippy when I talk about her or wear anything that belonged to her (like my mom's old necklace I wear basically every day).

// Anyway, a few nights ago, we were out for dinner with my dad, stepmom, and her parents. Her mom asked about the necklace, and I said, ‚ÄúIt was my mom's. She gave it to me before she passed. I wear it every day.‚Äù

// Stepmom immediately cut in with,

// ‚ÄúWell, technically I'm your mom now. I've done more mothering in the last 8 years than she did in 10.‚Äù

// I swear the whole table went silent.

// I just laughed and said,

// ‚ÄúIf you think being a mom is about trying to erase the actual one, then yeah, you've been amazing.‚Äù

// She looked like she'd been slapped. Her mom gasped. My dad told me to apologize, but I refused. I said I was tired of her acting like my mom never existed, and I wasn't going to play along anymore.

// Now my stepmom is barely speaking to me, and my dad says I ‚Äúneed to be the bigger person‚Äù because ‚Äúshe's just trying to connect.‚Äù

// But to me, that didn't feel like connection ‚Äî that felt like erasure.

// AITA for calling her out in front of everyone?
